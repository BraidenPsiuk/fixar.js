## What is FIXAR?

FIXAR helps you have full control over how your 2D/3D scene is viewed. It automatically resizes your scene to make it as large as possible while maintaining an aspect ratio you define (and can change at any time). It does this by creating a letterboxing/pillarboxing effect, which avoids stretching or cropping (which can look ugly or cause a loss of detail, respectively).

### Usage

```javascript
import * as THREE from "https://unpkg.com/three@latest/build/three.module.js";
import * as FIXAR from "https://unpkg.com/fixar@latest/fixar.js"; // TODO: add fixar.min.js
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/BraidenPsiuk/fixar.js/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
